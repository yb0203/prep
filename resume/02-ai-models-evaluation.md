# AI Models Evaluation Framework for LLMs

## Overview
Developed a comprehensive LLM evaluation framework to identify and assess OWASP security vulnerabilities specific to banking use cases, enabling safer AI model deployment in financial systems.

## Problem Statement
- Banks need to deploy LLMs but face security and compliance risks
- Limited tools to evaluate security vulnerabilities in LLMs for banking context
- Need to ensure compliance with financial industry standards (OWASP Top 10, PCI-DSS, RBI guidelines)
- Business requirements often misaligned with technical implementation
- No standardized way to assess model safety before production deployment

## Key Achievements
- **Identified 10+ OWASP security vulnerabilities** - Comprehensive vulnerability mapping for banking use case
- **Custom modular framework** - Developed extensible evaluation framework using DeepEval
- **Business-requirements integration** - Successfully translated business needs into technical specifications
- **Reusable components** - Built modular classes enabling framework scalability
- **Design documentation** - Created high-level design docs and roadmaps for continued development

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: DeepEval for LLM evaluation
- **Custom Classes**: Modular, composable evaluation components
- **Vulnerability Mapping**: OWASP Top 10 adapted for LLM security context
- **Architecture**: Extensible evaluation pipeline for multiple model types

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- AI/ML security and threat modeling
- Framework design and architecture
- Python development and OOP principles
- Security vulnerability assessment and remediation
- Documentation and knowledge transfer
- Technical leadership in emerging technology domains

## Business Impact
- Reduced security risk in AI model deployment
- Enabled faster LLM adoption with confidence in compliance
- Created repeatable evaluation process for all AI initiatives
- Positioned organization as security-conscious in AI implementation
- Provided audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Security Vulnerabilities Assessed
- Prompt injection and jailbreaking attempts
- Data poisoning and training data manipulation
- Model inversion and membership inference attacks
- Hallucination and accuracy issues with sensitive data
- Bias and fairness concerns in banking context
- Information disclosure and privacy breaches

## Key Learnings
- Importance of security-first approach in emerging technologies
- Banking sector has unique compliance requirements beyond standard OWASP
- Building flexible frameworks accelerates adoption across teams
- Documentation is critical for framework adoption and maintenance
