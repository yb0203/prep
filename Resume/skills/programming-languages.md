## Proficiency Evidence

### Java
- **Depth**: Primary professional language. Used daily at Kotak Mahindra Bank for building and maintaining the Finacle API automation framework and a multi-protocol performance testing framework. Comfortable with OOP design, collections (List, Map, Set), streams for pipeline processing, and basic concurrency (ExecutorService, thread pools for parallel test execution).
- **Used in**: Finacle API automation framework, performance engineering framework
- **Comfort level**: Can design class hierarchies, write modular testable code, and reason about thread safety at a practical level. Not expert-level in deep concurrency (locks, CAS) but solid for application-layer work.

### Python
- **Depth**: Secondary but most versatile language in portfolio. Used for Flask REST API development, scripting/automation, and all AI/ML work — LangChain pipelines, DeepEval evaluation harnesses, Ollama integrations.
- **Used in**: Centralized Report Server (Flask), AI Models Evaluation framework (DeepEval), GitaBae RAG chatbot (LangChain + Pinecone), Vibe Check MCP server
- **Comfort level**: Comfortable with standard libraries, virtual environments, pip packaging, list comprehensions, decorators, and async basics. Most productive in Python for rapid prototyping and AI tooling.

### C++
- **Depth**: Academic and competitive programming background from IIT BHU. Familiar with STL (vectors, maps, priority queues), pointers, memory management, and common algorithmic patterns.
- **Used in**: IIT BHU coursework, competitive programming contests — not used in professional projects.

### SQL
- **Depth**: Intermediate. Used for database queries in banking project contexts — writing SELECT statements with JOINs (inner, left), GROUP BY aggregations, and basic index awareness for query optimization. Familiar with relational schema design.
- **Used in**: Banking domain projects at Kotak Mahindra Bank; querying Finacle-related data stores.

### C
- **Depth**: Academic foundation from IIT BHU coursework. Understands pointers, memory allocation (malloc/free), structs, and basic systems programming concepts. Not used professionally.
- **Used in**: IIT BHU undergraduate coursework (systems programming, OS concepts).

### JavaScript
- **Depth**: Light usage, primarily frontend. Used for interactive elements and basic DOM manipulation on the report server dashboard (chart rendering, dynamic table updates).
- **Used in**: Centralized Report Server frontend dashboard.

## Anticipated Questions
- Q: Which is your strongest language?
  - A: Java is my strongest for production/professional work — I've built and maintained frameworks with it at Kotak. Python is my strongest for AI/ML and rapid prototyping. If the role is Java-focused, I'd lead with Java; if it's ML/data-focused, Python.
- Q: Rate yourself 1-10 in [language]
  - A: Java — 7/10 (solid OOP and testing, not deep in JVM internals or advanced concurrency). Python — 7/10 (very comfortable for scripting and AI work, not a data science/numpy expert). C++ — 5/10 (competitive programming level, not production-grade). SQL — 5/10 (comfortable with standard queries and joins, not a DBA). JavaScript — 3/10 (functional for frontend basics, not a JS developer).
