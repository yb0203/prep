## Context
B.Tech in Mining Engineering from IIT (BHU), Varanasi. The mining-to-software transition is a common interview talking point.

## Key Claims & Evidence

### "B.Tech (Mining Engineering), IIT (BHU), Varanasi — 8.39/10 — 2023"
- **What**: 4-year undergraduate degree at one of India's top engineering institutes (IIT BHU, formerly IT-BHU, established 1919 — one of the oldest technical institutes in India, with IIT status since 2012). Graduated 2023 with a CGPA of 8.39/10.
- **Relevance to SDE**:
  - Took CS electives including Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Programming (C/C++), and Numerical Methods — standard technical electives available to non-CS branches at IIT BHU.
  - Self-taught Python and Java during the second and third years of college, starting with automation scripts for academic projects and progressing to competitive programming and personal projects.
  - Participated in coding competitions on Codeforces and LeetCode from second year onward, building a consistent problem-solving practice.
  - Was part of the college's programming/technical community — attended and participated in inter-department hackathons and technical fests (Technex, IIT BHU's annual techfest, one of the largest in central India).
  - Final-year project involved simulation and data analysis components, which required writing Python scripts for processing geological and experimental data — this was the practical on-ramp to serious programming.
- **CGPA context**: 8.39/10 is a strong CGPA at IIT BHU. IIT entrance (JEE Advanced) is one of the most competitive exams globally — roughly 150,000–200,000 students qualify JEE Mains each year, and only ~16,000 clear JEE Advanced for IIT admission. Mining Engineering at IIT BHU typically requires a JEE Advanced rank in the 8,000–12,000 range, placing Yashvi solidly in the top 0.1% of engineering aspirants nationally.

### "Class XII (CBSE) — 94.20% — 2018"
- **Context**: Scored 94.20% in the CBSE Class XII board exams (PCM stream — Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), the standard pre-engineering track. This is a strong board score in the year of JEE preparation — maintaining above 90% in boards while simultaneously preparing for JEE Advanced reflects strong time management and consistent academic discipline. Strong performance in Mathematics and Physics, which are the analytical foundations for algorithms and systems thinking.

### "Class X (CBSE) — 95.00% — 2016"
- **Context**: Scored 95.00% in CBSE Class X boards. Demonstrates a consistent high-performance academic track from school through college — not a one-time spike. Strong in Mathematics and Science from an early age. This academic baseline is what made the IIT entrance possible and reflects the same rigorous, detail-oriented approach now applied to engineering problems at Kotak.

## Talking Points
- The mining-to-SDE story: what triggered the switch, when, how
- IIT BHU brand recognition and rigor
- Self-taught programming — Python then Java — during college years
- Hackathons at Technex (IIT BHU techfest), coding competitions on Codeforces/LeetCode, CS electives
- The analytical and systems-thinking foundation from engineering curriculum directly transferred to software architecture

## Anticipated Questions
- Q: Why mining engineering if you wanted to be a software engineer?
  - A: Honest answer: I didn't know I wanted to be a software engineer when I joined. I cleared JEE Advanced and chose mining at IIT BHU because IIT was the goal — the branch was secondary. In my second year, I took an intro programming elective and something clicked. I started solving problems on Codeforces, then built small Python scripts for my academic projects, then started thinking about building actual systems. By third year it was clear this was what I wanted to do professionally. I spent the last two years of college deliberately building toward that — CS electives, self-study, projects, competitive programming. The IIT rigor gave me the discipline. Mining gave me something unexpected too: systems thinking. You learn to reason about complex, interdependent underground systems where one failure cascades. That mental model transfers directly to distributed software architecture.

- Q: What CS-related things did you do at IIT BHU?
  - A: A few things. I took Data Structures and Algorithms and Numerical Methods as electives, which gave me the formal CS foundation. Outside class, I was active on Codeforces and LeetCode — competitive programming was how I got comfortable with problem-solving under constraints. I participated in hackathons at Technex, IIT BHU's annual technical festival. My final-year project had a significant data analysis and simulation component, which I built in Python — that was my first real experience writing code that solved a non-trivial domain problem. And I self-studied Java from second year onward because I knew most backend engineering roles in India, especially in finance, run on Java.

- Q: How did you prepare for the SDE role transition?
  - A: Systematically. First, I identified the gap: my degree was not CS, so I needed to close that gap on fundamentals and on practical project experience. For fundamentals, I did DSA consistently — LeetCode, Codeforces, standard competitive programming practice. For practical experience, I built personal projects (including GitaBae, a conversational AI project, which was also my way of learning about LLMs before they were mainstream). I read about system design — distributed systems, databases, API design. When I interviewed at Kotak Mahindra Bank in my final year, I came in knowing Java, Python, basic distributed systems concepts, and with actual projects to talk about. The offer came before graduation, so the preparation worked. Once I joined, the learning accelerated significantly because I was building real production systems from day one.

## Transition Narrative (for interviewers who push deeper)
"Mining gave me systems thinking — the ability to reason about complex, interdependent systems where failures cascade in non-obvious ways. Underground mining systems are deeply interconnected: ventilation, support structures, water management, extraction sequences. You learn to think in dependencies and failure modes. That transferred directly to software architecture. When I design a distributed system, I'm asking the same questions: what are the failure modes, what depends on what, how do you isolate failures so they don't cascade? The domain changed. The thinking style didn't."
