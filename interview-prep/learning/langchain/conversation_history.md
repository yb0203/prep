I Hello Claude,

I want to learn Land Chain. I am familiar with AI agents and elements, and I am very new to any AI frameworks so I want to start from scratch learning Land Chain.

Can you help me build small projects using Land Chain and help me understand what exactly it is? Can we use Land Chain in real life?

Bro, you do not need to create any files or folders until I want you to create them. I will explicitly ask you to do it. Until then you just have to suggest me what I should learn, how should I learn, etc. Create me a plan and all those stuff. You do not need to create any script or requirements file or anything else. Right so undo everything you have done until now and just give me a plan on how I can start learning

Create a plan.md file in the root of the directory and I'll explore it later

I want to build a good project, say a chatbot which has a databse of documents, which we will discuss in depth. I want to use langchain for this. Let's start step by step our discussion and make a plan on how to achieve this. DOn't code unless explicitly stated

so I want to create a chatbot which helps you and answers you based on the teachings of the Gita. It should give you the verses, take your concerns or problems or questions and answer accordingly. What I am thinking is we can upload different types of Gita which are present in PDF format, which will serve as the documents that LM will use to answer the questions. How does it sound?

This should be the format: GitaBae - AI Wisdom Chatbot                                                                           
  The Better Hack - 1st Runner-up in 2 days hackathon 
Built a production RAG chatbot using LangChain, Pinecone vector search, and OpenAI embeddings to provide contextual responses from 47 religious verses       
Implemented vector similarity search using Pinecone and OpenAI embeddings for context retrieval 
Developed content moderation system with topic filtering, crisis detection, and prompt injection protection
everything should fit in one line
