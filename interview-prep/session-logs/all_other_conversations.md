What can be done? I want the text extracted for Chapter 1. Read at least the first 100 pages

## Message 4 - [2025-12-15 21:30:12]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

Create a Python script to randomly get let's say page number 50-60 and check which chapter and verse that particular segment of PDF is. And based on it decipher whether you want to move forward or backward until you get to the exact set of pages in which chapter 1 lies. Once you are in chapter 1, or extract the pages of chapter 1 and make a copy of the PDF. Now the PDFs will be very small and then you can take the content out of it. This is how you should approach

Create a Python script to randomly get let's say page number 50-60 of the recently downloaded gita fileand check which chapter and verse that particular segment of PDF is. And based on it decipher whether you want to move forward or backward until you get to the exact set of pages in which chapter 1 lies. Once you are in chapter 1, or extract the pages of chapter 1 and make a copy of the PDF. Now the PDFs will be very small and then you can take the content out of it. This is how you should approach

**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

can you access the bhagvad_gita_PRD doc in downloads. Use this as a refrence and let's plan on how to create it. Don't code until the plan is finalised.

## Message 10 - [2025-12-17 00:06:03]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

I also want to add tags to the verses. add very lightweight automatic tags using an LLM (e.g., for each verse, ask the model “What 2–3 themes apply to this verse?"). This ensures proper structure and relevance of answers. What happens if I start with chapter 1 only, how can i add the whole gita for v1. So for chunking strategy I think we should go ahead with per commentary block. We can discuss on this further more for OpenAI model for responses. Now let's use GPT 3.5 turbo and for safety layer depth use enhanced moderation plus custom topic filtrations. Also provide a good name for the project. Don't start coding or create any files right now 

---

## Message 11 - [2025-12-17 00:14:05]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

For chunking I think I would like to go with option C hybrid model.

For project name suggest more fun names that will speak to audience of young professionals in India.

Third is I want to understand where will the embeddings get stored. I want to use some DB to store the vector embeddings instead of the local storage so we need to decide on that also.

For project location we can create in projects but don't do that now until and unless everything is finalised.

Also I think we should start with Chapter One first and then if that works well and went fine then we can update that to full Gita

## Message 14 - [2025-12-17 00:36:16]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

So you can proceed with Git and Github setup. After that I have the OpenRouter API key and I will create mine Pinecone API key after this

## Message 17 - [2025-12-17 00:47:19]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

I have done the GitHub authentication. I am trying to set up the Pinecone API key. In that there are a few configuration options such as:
- Lyzr Text Embedded V2 which is Nvidia hosted multilingual e-file large Microsoft hosted
- There are some text embedding 3 large configurations by OpenAI
What should I choose in that? After this when I confirm everything is set up, then only you start coding. For now you can just create the directory structure

---

## Message 18 - [2025-12-17 00:52:26]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

I have set up my Pinecone the set details now we can start coding as per the plan. Implement phase-by-phase, not implement everything at once. Implement phase 1 and document. Create the README alongside and push the changes to the remote GitHub repository after each phase

I want to highlight that the JSON file created of Chapter 1 doesn't have the verse 1, it starts from verse 2. Can you check and edit that first?

## Message 40 - [2025-12-17 23:23:14]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

okay, it is opening now, but answers are not very good. it's not interactive, and only gives the output as verse and its transalation. How can we improve this

---

## Message 41 - [2025-12-17 23:49:52]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

okay, this basic version is working fine. while there are few enhancements that needs to be done to make the conversation more flowing, and maybe more human, right now the answers are in a very restricted format and each answer is a new thread. also i would like to make the system prompt dynamic so that this app can learn from the conversations. keep this in the context file for now, we will create a list of enhancements required in that doc and implement those after all the phases are implemented.

---

## Message 42 - [2025-12-17 23:53:49]

## Message 48 - [2025-12-18 00:35:05]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

I also want to enhance the code. I want it to follow design principles, proper coding practices and smaller files. I also want to take out time to understand the code and the concepts used. We may not do every enhancemnt that were mentioned above, but we will take easy to do tasks and add the whole gita.

"🪷 GitaBae is reflecting" is still coming inside a box, also the conversation is still not good. not every answer should link to gita, for For example for phrases like "ok tell me more," the answer should not refer to some Gita words or something. So tell me how to improve that

Use the text file to generate the planned JSON and then generate tags and embeddings for the universes. Keep in mind that there are no empty verses or empty translations. Make sure that the text is extracted properly and tagged properly. You can try to club the verses for better performance

i have a concern, admin access will be given to all whoever can access the website. this is not good, if we implement the above updation of system prompt, it will be a disaster. How can we address it

I am thinking that this project is becoming very complicated. Let's not do the prompt improvement/feedback part. Let's keep it to the phase 3 only. can you revert the changes

let's go question by question, we wil discuss each question in detail, regarding the process, technology, etc. Whenever we have satisfied answers for each questions, we will add that in a file with both question and answer and other relevant information

[Pasted text #1 +4 lines] So it was only self-initiated and no any hackathon or course project. It was because of my self-motivation. This took around a week because I was building it on and off after the office hours or on weekends or whenever I got free time. I used Claude Code for building this and I learned about the technologies online etc

I want to have answers for all the above questions. Let's create a set of all questions that can be asked, and then try to answer those. ANd if there's a knowledge gap, I will learn about it.[Pasted text #1 +10 lines] [Pasted text #2 +4 lines] add more such questions

does the embedding models cost anything, if not then can we use the best model? models like text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are part of OpenAI ecosystem only? after this I will answer your questions

## Message 130 - [2026-01-20 10:23:05]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

How are the tokens and the context length of the LLM related? What do we mean when we say that the tokens have exhausted and when the LLM asks us to wait for reassurance of tokens? 

---

## Message 131 - [2026-01-20 10:32:07]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

What is meant by a request? One request. What is considered in a one request? Is it a one exchange of conversation between the user and the LLM or is it a full conversation exchange? 

---

## Message 132 - [2026-01-20 10:37:38]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

This is a good approach and I understand what is happening.

I have a query: How can we make sure that the LLM has all the context along with not hitting the token limit? How can we maintain the context throughout the conversation until an user wants it and also not exhausting the tokens?How to make sure that the LLM doesn't hallucinate because it has lost the context

I want to understand more about the different vector databases and I want to understand why Pine Cone is being used and more about Chrome and Qdrant.

**Project:** /Users/yashvi/Downloads

Chrome is a lightweight DB and can be easily set up on local but for production it means a hosting platform also doesn't scale well. Quadrant is a very fast DB which also needs to be hosted but it scales very well. If GitBake grew to 1 million vs I would use Quadrant and self-host it

**Project:** /Users/yashvi

What I want you to do is find all my Claude conversations especially around interview preparation and organise those conversations in this directory. This will be my primary interview preparation directory and for every domain, concept, and company I want to have dedicated interview preparations. In the.Claude file in my system you would find the conversations in JSON-L files. I need you to extract those conversations and place them here so that I can continue my conversation in a very organised manner in this particular directory

## Message 142 - [2026-01-29 09:59:02]
**Project:** /Users/yashvi

Also ensure that during the interview bit of conversation earlier, what I have did was detail out about my projects and all the information relevant for the conversation. So I analyse the complete conversation set and make the interview preparation directory extremely exhaustive of all the conversation I have had so far
