so I want to create a chatbot which helps you and answers you based on the teachings of the Gita. It should give you the verses, take your concerns or problems or questions and answer accordingly. What I am thinking is we can upload different types of Gita which are present in PDF format, which will serve as the documents that LM will use to answer the questions. How does it sound?

I also want to add tags to the verses. add very lightweight automatic tags using an LLM (e.g., for each verse, ask the model “What 2–3 themes apply to this verse?"). This ensures proper structure and relevance of answers. What happens if I start with chapter 1 only, how can i add the whole gita for v1. So for chunking strategy I think we should go ahead with per commentary block. We can discuss on this further more for OpenAI model for responses. Now let's use GPT 3.5 turbo and for safety layer depth use enhanced moderation plus custom topic filtrations. Also provide a good name for the project. Don't start coding or create any files right now

I have done the GitHub authentication. I am trying to set up the Pinecone API key. In that there are a few configuration options such as:
- Lyzr Text Embedded V2 which is Nvidia hosted multilingual e-file large Microsoft hosted
- There are some text embedding 3 large configurations by OpenAI
What should I choose in that? After this when I confirm everything is set up, then only you start coding. For now you can just create the directory structure

I have set up my Pinecone the set details now we can start coding as per the plan. Implement phase-by-phase, not implement everything at once. Implement phase 1 and document. Create the README alongside and push the changes to the remote GitHub repository after each phase

I also want to enhance the code. I want it to follow design principles, proper coding practices and smaller files. I also want to take out time to understand the code and the concepts used. We may not do every enhancemnt that were mentioned above, but we will take easy to do tasks and add the whole gita.

Save what we've discussed about Safety to the file first and then let's cover the pending questions. ALso explain me in summary about safety that we have discussed

I want to have answers for all the above questions. Let's create a set of all questions that can be asked, and then try to answer those. ANd if there's a knowledge gap, I will learn about it.[Pasted text #1 +10 lines] [Pasted text #2 +4 lines] add more such questions

does the embedding models cost anything, if not then can we use the best model? models like text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large are part of OpenAI ecosystem only? after this I will answer your questions

I identify potential interview questions based on the JD and my background. We will discuss questions and answers that can be asked in the interview. We will discuss about concepts that I may not understand or I am weak

Can we first discuss about topics like Postgres and DB and containerization because I am very weak in those and I need to have a little bit of understanding so that I can talk the interview about them

Can you help me more with understanding the DBs, how indexing works, how primary key and foreign key work, all the concepts and questions related to that. Very basics and fundamentals of DB and about PostgreSQL. What is it? Why we use it? And recently they have migrated to Supabase also. So help me with that information so that I can ask and give answers

Make a new directory called "interview-prep" and go inside that directory

What I want you to do is find all my Claude conversations especially around interview preparation and organise those conversations in this directory. This will be my primary interview preparation directory and for every domain, concept, and company I want to have dedicated interview preparations. In the.Claude file in my system you would find the conversations in JSON-L files. I need you to extract those conversations and place them here so that I can continue my conversation in a very organised manner in this particular directory
